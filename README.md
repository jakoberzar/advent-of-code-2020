# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020. I like to use Advent of Code to get some practice on languages which I haven't used a lot of. This year, I was satisfied with using Rust, so I didn't really try write in other languages as much as I planned. I might write additional solutions in other languages sometime later.

## Rust

### Running code

```bash
cargo run --release -p day-01-rust
```

### Testing code

```bash
cargo test -p day-01-rust
```

### Create new day

```bash
cargo new -p day-25-rust
```

## F\#

### Running code in F\#

```bash
cd day-05-fsharp
dotnet run
```

### Create new day in F\#

```bash
mkdir day-25-fsharp
cd day-25-fsharp
dotnet new console --language F#
# Also, don't forget about declaring namespace and module in the file!
```

## Other language candidates

- Ruby or Crystal too see what Ruby feels like?
- Zig or Go to learn another systems language?
- Compile-time C++?
- PHP to test out the PHP 8 JIT?
- SIC/XE assembly for some quality time spent writing assembly?
- PREV? Lox? Own language?
